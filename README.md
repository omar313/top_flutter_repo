# top_flutter_repo

A Flutter application which shows the top 50 most starred, last updated and best matches  github repositories by using github api.
I have used the  `FLutter_bloc` for state management and for network calls I have used the  Flutter package `Dio`. For caching data I have used shared_preferences plugin .
